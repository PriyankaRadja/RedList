# RedList
Data analysis project on the top 3 eco-regions with the highest number of endangered and critically endangered species (redlist species) using R, Javascript, Html and Css.

## Map using R
The map was generated using R. The respective code can be found at code/forestmap.r. Pop-up texts display details of the 3 eco-regions with the highest redlist species. The map was embedded into the html page using the <object> element.
  
## Donut Chart
The donut chart was generated with the help of Chart.js in script/piechart.js. The chart displays the total number of species for each category (Endangered Species, Critically Endangered Species and Other Species) on hover over their respective sections in the chart.

## Hover Module
Simple CSS animation was used to display the top 5 endangered species in the Northwestern Andean Forest on hover of the mouse over the forest's hover module div element.
